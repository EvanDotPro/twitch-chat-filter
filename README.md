# Twitch Chat Filter

Version 0.1.2

## Description

Currently there are no settings, but this add-on will hide Twitch chat messages:

- Single word messages (@mentions, repeated words, single letters, and numbers do not count as words).
- Emote only messages.
- Sub and resub notifications.
- Works on live stream chats (inline and pop-out) and VOD playback chats.

It also hides the obnoxious leaderboard at the top of the chat.

There are a few rules specific to the type of messages common in Kitboga's channel, but they shouldn't affect the chat filter working on other channels.

At some point, if there is any interest, I will make this configurable.

## Installation

Available for Firefox on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitch-chat-filter/).

Coming soon to the Chrome store (pending review).
